# The cache is implemented using a combination of a hash table (python
# dictionary) and a circular doubly linked list. Objects in the cache are
# stored in nodes. These nodes make up the linked list. The list is used to
# efficiently maintain the order that the objects have been used in. The front
# or "head" of the list contains the most recently used object, the "tail" of
# the list contains the least recently used object. When an object is "used" it
# can easily (in a constant amount of time) be moved to the front of the list,
# thus updating its position in the ordering. These nodes are also placed in
# the hash table under their associated key. The hash table allows efficient
# lookup of objects by key.

# The doubly linked list is composed of nodes. Each
# node has a 'prev' and 'next' variable to hold the node that comes before
# it and after it respectivly. Initially the two variables each point to
# the node itself, creating a circular doubly linked list of size one. Each
# node has a 'obj' and 'key' variable, holding the object and the key it is
# stored under respectivly.
